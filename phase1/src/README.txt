# User Guideline

===

Run the main.Main to start the program.

We have five default accounts in the program:
    - Organizer:
        - email: org@admin.com
        - password: 123456
    - Speaker1:
        - email: spk1@admin.com
        - password: 123456
    - Speaker2:
        - email: spk2@admin.com
        - password: 123456
    - Attendee1:
        - email: atd1@admin.com
        - password: 123456
    - Attendee1:
        - email: atd2@admin.com
        - password: 123456

Also two default events and two default messages currently stored in the program.

===

In any menu, please enter the integer in [] before option to perform the operation.

Room and time are labelled as R101 and 12:00, but your input need to be 101 and 12.

When preforming any operation, please follow the instruction shown in console.

===

Register a new account in account system can only create Attendee account.

To create a speaker account, log in as Organizer and enter Event system.

You cannot create Organizer account.

===

It would be SAFE to have at least one event and one message in the system. So do not cancel all the events.

===

To generate default data, use gateway.BackDoor.

===

Attendee signing up for an event will not have conflict checking.
